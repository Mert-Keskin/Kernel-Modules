Description

The memchardev kernel module implements a simple character device driver that demonstrates memory management in the Linux kernel. The module uses kmalloc for memory allocation and kfree for memory deallocation.

Write Operation: Writes data to a kernel buffer.

Read Operation: Reads data from the kernel buffer.

Dynamic Memory Management: The module dynamically allocates memory using kmalloc when the device is opened and frees it with kfree when the device is closed.

This example highlights how to work with dynamically allocated memory in the kernel, as well as how to handle user-space communication via character devices.
