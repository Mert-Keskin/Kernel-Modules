Description

The racechardev is a simple character device driver for Linux that demonstrates how spinlocks can be used to prevent race conditions in a shared resource scenario. This module includes basic read and write operations on a shared global variable (counter), which is protected using a spinlock to ensure synchronization.

Write Operation: Each byte written to the device increments the counter variable.

Read Operation: The current value of the counter is returned when reading from the device.

Synchronization: The module uses a spinlock to safely modify the shared counter and prevent race conditions.

This example demonstrates the use of spinlocks to handle critical sections in kernel code.
