Overview

The irq_tasklet_demo kernel module demonstrates how to handle interrupts in Linux by using tasklets. Tasklets are a mechanism for deferring work to the bottom half of interrupt handling, allowing the top half (the interrupt handler) to quickly return control to the kernel, and then processing the deferred work in the bottom half.

This module listens for keyboard interrupts on IRQ 1 (the standard IRQ for keyboards on x86 systems). When the interrupt occurs, the module performs the top half of the interrupt handling (the IRQ handler) and then schedules the bottom half of the processing using a tasklet.

Features

Handles keyboard interrupts on IRQ 1.

Uses tasklets to defer work to the bottom half.

Logs messages for both the top and bottom half interrupt handling.

Provides basic logging for module loading and unloading.
